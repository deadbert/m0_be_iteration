# Self Evaluation

## How might the `each` method be useful?
- Anytime I need to perform a repeated set of actions on a set of data
## What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
- I know there are a lot of built in methods in Ruby to simplify iterating over data sets, I would like to learn a good set of useful methods to have on hand
## What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
- I used the approach to iteration using `each` that was covered in the lesson plan, and discovered it's a great tool to easily iterate in Ruby
